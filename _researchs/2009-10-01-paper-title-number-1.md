excerpt: 'We document that return predictability is an asset-specific characteristic linked to the cross-section of expected returns, rather than a uniform feature of selected predictors or models. Utilizing a novel tree-based clustering framework, we partition the U.S. equity return panel based on rich firm characteristics and market-wide variables to capture heterogeneity in predictability across assets and market states. We find that stocks with large earnings surprises, high earnings-to-price ratios, and low trading volumes exhibit the strongest predictability. Besides, predictability is also time-varying. It diminishes sharply with low market dividend yield but peaks with high market dividend yield and limited market liquidity. Out-of-sample, a predictability differential strategy that leverages investors’ model misspecification generates monthly alphas exceeding 1%, and investing in highly predictable clusters significantly outperforms conventional benchmarks with Sharpe ratios approaching 2.'

We document that return predictability is an asset-specific characteristic linked to the cross-section of expected returns, rather than a uniform feature of selected predictors or models. Utilizing a novel tree-based clustering framework, we partition the U.S. equity return panel based on rich firm characteristics and market-wide variables to capture heterogeneity in predictability across assets and market states. We find that stocks with large earnings surprises, high earnings-to-price ratios, and low trading volumes exhibit the strongest predictability. Besides, predictability is also time-varying. It diminishes sharply with low market dividend yield but peaks with high market dividend yield and limited market liquidity. Out-of-sample, a predictability differential strategy that leverages investors’ model misspecification generates monthly alphas exceeding 1%, and investing in highly predictable clusters significantly outperforms conventional benchmarks with Sharpe ratios approaching 2.
