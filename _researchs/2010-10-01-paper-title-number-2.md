title: "Heterogeneous Measures of Corporate Bond Liquidity"
collection: researchs
category: working_paper
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'We develop a novel measure of corporate bond liquidity that integrates a goal-oriented clustering approach. While existing liquidity proxies—whether asset-specific or data-driven—often overlook the interconnected effects across segments critical to investors and regulators, we show that corporate bond liquidity predictability is inherently heterogeneous, varying significantly across bonds and over time. Our method constructs a tree-based structure to recursively form internally homogeneous clusters, employing partition criteria such as root mean squared error to substantially enhance within-group predictive accuracy. Through iterative targeted variable partitioning, we reveal mosaic-like patterns in liquidity predictability, demonstrating that cluster-specific models outperform pooled approaches. Furthermore, our findings remain economically interpretable, aligning with bond ratings, market volatility, and macroeconomic indicators. We further extend our analysis to quantify the interplay between liquidity and transaction costs, offering actionable insights for both asset pricing and market regulation.'

We develop a novel measure of corporate bond liquidity that integrates a goal-oriented clustering approach. While existing liquidity proxies—whether asset-specific or data-driven—often overlook the interconnected effects across segments critical to investors and regulators, we show that corporate bond liquidity predictability is inherently heterogeneous, varying significantly across bonds and over time. Our method constructs a tree-based structure to recursively form internally homogeneous clusters, employing partition criteria such as root mean squared error to substantially enhance within-group predictive accuracy. Through iterative targeted variable partitioning, we reveal mosaic-like patterns in liquidity predictability, demonstrating that cluster-specific models outperform pooled approaches. Furthermore, our findings remain economically interpretable, aligning with bond ratings, market volatility, and macroeconomic indicators. We further extend our analysis to quantify the interplay between liquidity and transaction costs, offering actionable insights for both asset pricing and market regulation.
