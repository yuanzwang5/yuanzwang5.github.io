excerpt: 'We propose a deep learning framework that directly estimates the tangency portfolio weights on thousands of individual assets by augmenting any benchmark factors with a long-short deep factor constructed from high-dimensional firm characteristics. The deep factor, generated by an economically guided neural network, plays two fundamental roles: (i) the market-hedged portfolio when the market is the benchmark, and (ii) spanning missing risk factors embedded in rich cross-sectional characteristics. Applied to U.S. corporate bonds, it achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of 1.0, and the resulting deep tangency portfolio attains 2.13, outperforming both standard observable and latent factors. We further show that bond returns incorporate broad information from equity and option characteristics, offering new evidence of integration between bond and equity markets.'

We propose a deep learning framework that directly estimates the tangency portfolio weights on thousands of individual assets by augmenting any benchmark factors with a long-short deep factor constructed from high-dimensional firm characteristics. The deep factor, generated by an economically guided neural network, plays two fundamental roles: (i) the market-hedged portfolio when the market is the benchmark, and (ii) spanning missing risk factors embedded in rich cross-sectional characteristics. Applied to U.S. corporate bonds, it achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio of 1.0, and the resulting deep tangency portfolio attains 2.13, outperforming both standard observable and latent factors. We further show that bond returns incorporate broad information from equity and option characteristics, offering new evidence of integration between bond and equity markets.
